\item \textbf{Whose House Was It Anyway?} The nuisance house in question, 265
West 93rd Street, was one of three row houses built in 1897--1898 by architect
Alexander M. Welch and developers William W. and Thomas M. Hall. The townhouses
were advertised as ``the most attractive, medium sized, moderate priced Private
Houses ever offered.'' \sentence{miller-boehm-house; landmark-west-265-w-93}.
When Dorothy Holloschitz came into ownership of the house is uncertain, but
according to the New York City property records, the house was sold at auction a
year after the judgment, for \$39,000. It was later converted to a four-unit
co-op. Unit 4 sold in 2016 for \$1.8 million.
