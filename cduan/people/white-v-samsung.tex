\append{White now appeals.\dots}{

\readinghead{I. Section 3344}

White first argues that the district court erred in rejecting her claim under
[California's statutory right of publicity,] section 3344. Section 3344(a)
provides, in pertinent part, that ``[a]ny person
who knowingly uses another's name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness, in
any manner,\ldots for purposes of advertising or selling,\ldots without such
person's prior consent\ldots shall be liable for any damages sustained by the
person or persons injured as a result thereof.''

\ldots. Without deciding for all purposes when a caricature or impressionistic
resemblance might become a ``likeness,'' we agree with the district court that
the robot at issue here was not White's ``likeness'' within the meaning of
section 3344. Accordingly, we affirm the court's dismissal of White's section
3344 claim.
