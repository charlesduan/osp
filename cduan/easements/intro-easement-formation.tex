Typically, an easement is created expressly through a conveyance from the
landowner to the benefit recipient. Easements can also arise by operation of
law. An implied easement is one that arises because of the geography and usage
of the parcels of land. There are two types: the easement implied by existing
use, and the easement by necessity. Additionally, an easement by prescription
can arise after a long period of acquiescence, akin to adverse possession.

Each of these three forms of non-express easements has specific (and often
jurisdiction-dependent) rules governing whether it exists. Pay close attention
to what the conditions of formation are, and ask yourself whether the rules are
justified and properly tailored.
