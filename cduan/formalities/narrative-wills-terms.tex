Because property in the material world is probably not of much use after death,
the law has rules for the disposal of property of the deceased. Generally, those
rules seek to effect the desires and intentions of the now-deceased owner,
either expressed in a written document called a \term{will} or according to
statutory rules in the absence of a will.

The following is a brief summary of the concepts and terminology used in the law
of wills and estates. It is not intended to be comprehensive; a more advanced
law school course is required for that. But it should provide a general sense
for the questions and issues that need to be dealt with in the process of
managing property after death.
