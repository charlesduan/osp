\term{Euclidean zoning}, so called based on the following case, concerns zoning
regulations limiting the uses to which land may be put. (Another type of zoning,
aesthetic zoning, relates to the appearance of buildings and structures; it is
discussed in the original \emph{Open Source Property} module on zoning but not
in this book.)
