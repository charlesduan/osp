We now address a final method of resolving incompatible property uses.
\textbf{Eminent domain}, also called \textbf{condemnation},
is the inherent power of the state to transfer title of
private property into state hands. In the United States, when the government
``takes'' land in this manner, it must comply with the Takings Clause of the
Fifth Amendment:
\begin{quote}
[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.
\end{quote}
This
brief constitutional provision encompasses three distinct issues that we will
deal with in this chapter (though not in this order): (1) has there been a
``taking'' of private property? (2) Is the taking for ``public use''; and (3)
has ``just compensation'' been provided?
