An \term{interest} is a person's property rights relating to something. The
concept of a property interest is important because it opens the door to
multiple people having different interests in the same thing---co‑owners of a
house, for example, or a bank's interest in a mortgaged house, for example. The
many arrangements of multiple property interests over a single thing are a key
topic of property law, explored in many chapters of this book. Terms like
``ownership'' and ``title,'' though colloquially used often, can often lead to
confusion in these multiple‑interest situations, and are perhaps best avoided.
