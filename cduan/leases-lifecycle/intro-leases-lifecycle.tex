The law of leases is a massive topic in property law---the original Leases
module of \emph{Open Source Property} spans over a hundred pages. In this
chapter, we'll cover the creation and termination of leases, and the next
chapter will cover the duties of landlords to tenants. If it should interest
you, here is a list of topics \emph{not} in this book but covered in the
original module:
\begin{itemize}
\item The difference between a lease and an invitee
\item Delivery of possession: what happens if the new tenant shows up but the
old one refuses to leave?
\item Anti-discrimination rules in selecting tenants
\item Landlord exit: what happens if the landlord sells the property while it's
being leased?
\item Contractual limits on assigning and subletting leases
\item Security deposits
\item Tort liability of landlords
\item Gentrification and rent control
\end{itemize}
If any of these interest you, pick up a copy of the full Leases module. It is a
great read and well worth your time.
