\emph{Frameworks of Property Law} is a free casebook for the first-year Property
Law course at American law schools, and anyone else with an interest in the
subject. It is available online, \url{https://www.github.com/charlesduan/osp}.
The book is based on \emph{Open Source Property},
\url{https://opensourceproperty.org}, a collection of open-source textbook
modules on property law. Because of the extensive edits to the present book, it
has been retitled to help ensure that students obtain the right copy.
