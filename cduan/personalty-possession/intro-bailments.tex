A \term{bailment} is an arrangement where the owner of personal property
entrusts the property to another. The owner is called the \term{bailor}, while
the recipient is called the \term{bailee}. Common bailees include delivery
services, dry cleaners, and friends who borrow others' casebooks. These
arrangements split full ownership from physical possession, and raise several
issues regarding the parties' respective rights. What are the duties between the
bailor and bailee? And what rights and duties do each of them have with respect
to third parties?
