Plaintiffs' land.\par\readinghead{II. Preliminary Discussion}\par [The court
reiterated that no one had addressed the possibility that Southwestern had
physically trespassed on the plaintiffs' land. The plaintiffs had not alleged it
in their pleadings, the appellate court had stated that there was no evidence of
a physical intrusion, and Southwestern had framed the issue before the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court as ``whether the rule of capture should be
applied\ldots to allow for the capture of oil and gas which merely drains from
an adjacent property after the completion of a well using hydraulic fracturing
solely within the developer's property.'' Thus, the court declined to review the
question of whether a physical intrusion had actually occurred.]}
