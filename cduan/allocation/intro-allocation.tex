So far we have looked at the rights that property owners have against the world,
and considered the wide spectrum of ways in which ownership can be shared or
divided. The next few chapters turn to a new category of problems: conflicts
between property owners, and how the law resolves those conflicts.
This chapter deals with conflicts of initial
acquisition---when two people claim to have gained ownership over the same
resource. Further chapters will consider conflicts arising between those who
already have property rights.
The common question to ask across these chapters: How do courts decide which
property right must yield to the other, and why?
