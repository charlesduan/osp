So far we have looked at the rights that property owners have against the world,
and considered the wide spectrum of ways in which ownership can be shared or
divided. The next few chapters turn to a new category of problems: conflicts
between property owners, and how the law resolves those conflicts.

Four such conflicts are explored. This chapter deals with conflicts of initial
acquisition---when two people claim to have gained ownership over the same
resource. Next, we consider conflicts between different classes of
property---when real property rights clash with personal property, or
intellectual property clashes with tangible property. We then turn to the
problem of nuisance---when one property owner's use interferes with another's.
The common question to ask across these chapters: How do courts decide which
property right must yield to the other, and why? Finally, we'll round out the
discussion of property-versus-property conflicts with a mechanism for property
owners to negotiate out private resolutions, called covenants.
