\replacerange{The mail fraud statute}{indictment must be denied.}{[The relevant
mail fraud statute makes it a crime to use the Postal Service for various forms
of fraud and counterfeiting. The court explains that, under the case
\emph{McNally v.~United States}, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), the Supreme Court has
interpreted this mail fraud statute such that it applies only to defrauding
someone out of property (as opposed to, say, defrauding the public out of a
properly functioning political process). You might question that outcome, but
accept it as a given for purposes of this case.

Under this rule, the defendants have committed mail fraud only if the defendants
defrauded New York City, as a property holder, out of its property. The court
first observes that the city lost license renewal fees, which are money, which
are the city's property. That's enough to overcome the motion to dismiss. But
the court goes on:]}
