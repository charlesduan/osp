Where does one person's property end, and another's begin? For some things, this
is an easy question. A pen and a desk, for example, have distinct boundaries,
defined by the surfaces of the objects. So if Alice owns a pen and places the
pen on Bob's desk, it is clear what belongs to Alice and what belongs to Bob. Or
is it so clear? What if Alice draws on Bob's desk, depositing a trail of ink
from the pen?

Defining the boundaries of things is fundamental to property law, and unclear
boundaries are classic subjects of property disputes. Land is the most common
example. The lateral boundaries of land, of course, but what about vertical? How
far into the sky do a landowner's rights reach? And for intangible property,
these questions are even more difficult. At least for tangible things, humans
can perceive their size and shape; how does one do the same for the intangible?
