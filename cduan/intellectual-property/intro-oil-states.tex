Patents are a form of intellectual property, but are they ``property''? In this
case, the Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of administrative agency
process, called ``inter partes review,'' in which administrative judges at the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office decide whether a patent was erroneously granted
and have the power to revoke it. As part of its analysis of the constitutional
issue, the Court must consider whether patents are more like
government benefits, or more like private property.
