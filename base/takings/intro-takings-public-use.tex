The Fifth Amendment declares that if private property is taken ``for public
use'' compensation is required. What function does the term ``public use'' play
in the clause? One could read the phrase as descriptive, i.e., as describing
situations in which the government takes property via eminent domain (as opposed
to taking it via the exercise of other powers, like taxation or punishment for a
criminal offense). Under that reading, the only limit to the state's taking
authority is its willingness to pay (and the operation of other Constitutional
requirements, like Equal Protection, Due Process, or the like). The Supreme
Court takes a different view. Its precedent treats the term ``for public use''
as a \textit{substantive} limitation to the takings power, albeit not a strong
one.
