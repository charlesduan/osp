\textit{Tahoe}'s rejection of conceptual severance still left an important
question. Even if a court focuses on the ``parcel as a whole,'' it must still
define the parcel. What if the claimant owns multiple lots? Do we measure
regulatory effects on individual lots or the property owner's aggregate
holdings? \textit{See Lost Tree Vill. Corp. v. United States}, 707 F.3d 1286,
1293 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (focusing on the extent to which the owner treated
distinct parcels as ``a single economic unit''). The Supreme Court turned to the
issue in its 2016 term.
