\item Even the general warranty given by the Housworths is subject to
significant exceptions, including one for public roadways and one for zoning
regulations. What is the point of these exceptions? Did the court correctly
interpret those underlying policies as not covering the floodwater detention
easement?


\item The exception for zoning regulations can be tricky. Suppose that the
property is a vacant lot and that local zoning laws restrict houses to 15 feet
in height? Is this an encumbrance? What if the property contains a house 30
feet high? Would it make a difference in either case if the restriction came
from a private neighborhood covenant rather than a public zoning law?


\item What should the Housworths (or rather, their attorney) have done?
Presumably, the Oconee River Soil Conservation District is not interested in
terminating its easement. Are the Housworths stuck with an unsaleable tract of
land?
