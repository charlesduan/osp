\item The deed from Duryea \& Wilson to the plaintiff is called a ``wild deed.''
Why? Draw a diagram of the conveyances in \textit{Hughes}, noting which of them
were recorded. What would someone searching the title to the property have
found? Put another way, what went wrong here? Whose fault was it? What can or
should a recording system do about it?


\item What kind of recording act does Minnesota have, according to
\textit{Hughes}? How can you tell? Would the result have been different under
either of the other types of recording acts?


\item What result if Hughes had filled in his name on the blank deed when he
received it from Hoerger in 1906 rather than when he recorded it in 1910?
