Ladue is the wealthiest suburb of Missouri. Ladue's African-American population
is 1.0\%, compared to nearby Ferguson's 2/3rds. Per capita income in Ladue is
\$88,000, compared to Ferguson's under \$21,000.\footnote{A few years ago,
Ladue's police chief was fired, allegedly for refusing to target black drivers
who passed through the city limits. \emph{Former Ladue Police Chief alleges he
was ordered to profile black motorists}, \textsc{KMOV.com}, May 4, 2014,

Ladue sought to cover a \$300,000 city budget shortfall through traffic tickets
rather than by raising taxes on its millionaire homeowners. In 2006,
African-Americans made up 22.5\% of traffic stops by Ladue police. In 2014,
though the percentage had decreased somewhat, African-Americans were still 16
times as likely to be stopped as their percentage of the population would
predict. Walter Moskop, \emph{Traffic enforcement report: Black drivers in
Missouri still stopped at higher rate}, \textsc{St. Louis Post-Dispatch}, June
