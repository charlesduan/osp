When zoning first began, there were a number of existing uses that would be
prohibited by the new regimes. Zoning authorities expected these to die out
naturally, but in fact, they often persisted for decades, in part because they
often had local monopolies---a nonconforming use might be the only gas station
in a residential neighborhood, for example. Many supporters of zoning wanted to
do more to get rid of such uses.

Moreover, because zoning often changes---usually in the direction of becoming
more restrictive---existing uses that were fine under the previous zoning regime
can become newly unlawful. This is especially true when an unanticipated use
begins and the rest of the neighbors want to change the zoning in response. But
what about the interests of the property owner with the disfavored use, now
known as a \term{nonconforming use}?
