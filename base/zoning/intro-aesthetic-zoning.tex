There are many ways to attempt to control residents' ways of life. Recall that
single-family homes were promoted as ways to shape personhood and citizenship as
compared to apartments; the general idea of shaping our character by controlling
our buildings is the same even if the mechanisms change. Many traditionally
zoned areas have adopted aesthetic regulations. Typically, a city will pass an
ordinance setting up an Architectural Board to approve plans for buildings. This
was the case in Ladue, Missouri. It is perhaps notable that, despite the
demographic uniformity of Ladue's residents, they are still very interested in
controlling each other's property-related behavior through law rather than
merely through social norms.
