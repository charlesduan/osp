What is a ``McMansion,'' and why do the residents of Ladue dislike them? Why
might neighbors think that McMansions decrease property values or otherwise harm
them? They are far from alone. One letter writer lamented, ``All over Staten
Island, we have seen what happens when the wrong people buy the right homes.''

Island Live}, Nov. 5, 2007,

The author wanted to expand minimum lot sizes
and ban two-family homes on Staten Island, even though he acknowledged that
those changes wouldn't prevent McMansions, which were the subject of his
complaint. Perhaps more effectively, he also suggested that all the homes in his
area be designated historic to prevent teardowns.
