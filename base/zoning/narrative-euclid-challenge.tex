\reading{Note: Facial v. As-Applied Challenges}

\textit{Euclid} held that a zoning ordinance would not be struck down as an
unwarranted interference with property rights on its face, but left open the
possibility of as-applied challenges to applications of zoning to prohibit
particular developments. The Court then made clear that as-applied challenges
would almost always fail as well, unless the harm to the property owner rose to
the level of a taking requiring compensation under the Fifth and Fourteenth
amendments. \textit{See} \having{intro-takings}{Takings,
\textit{supra}}{Takings, \textit{infra}}{the Takings module of \emph{Open Source
Property}}. In the absence of a taking, courts were not to interfere with zoning
authorities' determinations unless they were arbitrary and irrational, even if
they were wrong. \emph{Nectow v. City of Cambridge}, 277 U.S. 183 (1928). Lower
courts received the Court's message clearly and left zoning authorities almost
entirely free to zone as they wished.
