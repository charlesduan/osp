Zoning's proponents hoped that comprehensive planning would result in a zoning
plan that would last into the indefinite future. Reality quickly set in, and
municipalities realized that they would need ongoing modification of their
zoning codes. New uses had to be included and excluded; plans had to be revised
to account for changes in population; and so on.
