At times, new zoning precludes uses that were previously allowed. The remaining
allowed uses may be inappropriate for a particular parcel of land within a zone.
Conditions may have changed, making previous zoning inappropriate, or developers
may wish to build more than current zoning allows. Zoning authorities may have
determined that particular uses are acceptable, but only under specified
conditions requiring a more detailed permit process. All these possibilities
require some way of addressing unusual conditions and ongoing change. This
section reviews various techniques zoning authorities use in such circumstances.
