names, faces, or parts of people can
be property.  Among other questions we will want to ask: Is labor necessary to
create property rights?  In the phenomenon known as ``accession,'' it's not: a
cow's owner automatically owns her calf, whether or not the owner invested
anything in the calf.  Is labor sufficient to create property rights?  Again,
the answer elsewhere is: not always.

Property is often called on to decide issues of morality.  Concepts of unjust
enrichment, in which someone wrongfully benefits from another's efforts, often
play a role in resolving property disputes, as we see in the following case
about owning attributes of identity, distinguishable from a physical body.
