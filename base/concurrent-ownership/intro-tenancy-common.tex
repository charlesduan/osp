\term[tenancy in common]{Tenancy in common} is the modern default form of
co-ownership, unless a contrary
intent is expressed; usually that intent must be in writing.  All tenants in
common are entitled to possession and use of the property.  Only
\term{partition}, discussed below, results in separate and divided interests.

Tenants in common need not own equal shares.  If there is no document or legal
rule of inheritance specifying their shares, courts will often look to the
contribution of the cotenants to the purchase in order to determine appropriate
shares.
