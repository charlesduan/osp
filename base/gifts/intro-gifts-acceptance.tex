As you've seen, acceptance is generally presumed for gifts of value.  Given that
presumption, why do you think acceptance is an element of a valid gift at all? 

If the donee doesn't want to accept the gift, then the donee may ``disclaim''
the gift.  This usually only arises in cases of attempted transfers by will.
