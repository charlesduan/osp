\item If you don't make a will, the state will make one for you. This portion of
the Maryland Code describes the default inheritance rules for people who die
domiciled in Maryland without a will. How well do you think they track people's
expectations about what will happen to their property after they die? In
addition to \textit{total intestacy}---dying without a will---the intestacy
statute also applies in cases of \textit{partial intestacy}---dying with a
will that fails to dispose of all of one's property. How might that happen?
