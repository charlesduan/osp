\item A few years after \textit{Nahrstedt} was decided, the California
legislature later enacted a statute providing that common-interest community
governing documents cannot prohibit the keeping of ``at least one pet.''
\textsc{Cal. Civ. Code} \S~4715.

\item Did Natore Nahrstedt lose because the pet restriction is reasonable in
general, because the restriction is reasonable as applied to indoor cats, or
because the fines levied by the board were a reasonable means of enforcing the
restriction?

\item Is the reasonableness standard applied in \textit{Nahrstedt} the same
standard applied by the court in \textit{Norman} and \textit{Basso}? If not, how
do the standards differ? How does the reasonableness standard of
\textit{Nahrstedt} differ from the standard Florida applies to CC\&Rs?
