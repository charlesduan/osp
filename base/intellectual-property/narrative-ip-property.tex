Despite the name, it is highly controversial whether intellectual property
should be considered a species of ``property'' at all. As you read the cases in
this section, consider why advocates might want to embrace or deny that label,
and what if anything is at stake. Also, pay close attention to the distinction
between the intellectual property rights in an object and property rights in
the object itself. (In copyright terms, this is the distinction between a
``work'' and a ``copy'' of the work.) These rights can overlap or conflict, and
some of the most important doctrines of intellectual property law are devoted
to sorting out these issues. Finally, consider the extent to which the fact
that intellectual property rights deal with information raises distinctive free
expression concerns.
