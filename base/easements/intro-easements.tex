\term[easement]{Easements} are interests in land. Unlike fee simple ownership,
they are
nonpossessory. Rather, they allow the easement holder to use or control someone
else's land. Suppose Anna owns Blackacre, and Brad owns Whiteacre, which borders
Blackacre. Anna would like to cross Whiteacre to reach Blackacre. She could ask
Brad for permission to cross, but even if he says yes, permission can be
revoked. Brad might also convey Whiteacre to a less welcoming owner. Anna may
therefore wish to acquire a property interest that gives her an
\textit{irrevocable} right to cross over Whiteacre. If Brad conveys her this
interest (by sale or grant), Anna now owns an \term{easement of access}, which
is a right to enter and cross through someone's land on the way to someplace
else.
