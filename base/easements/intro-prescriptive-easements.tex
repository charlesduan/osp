Easements may also arise from prescription. An easement by prescription is
acquired in a manner similar to adverse possession, as it is a non-permissive
use that ultimately ripens into a property interest. Recall the five elements of
adverse possession: Entry and possession that is (1) actual, (2) exclusive, (3)
hostile or under claim of right, (4) open and notorious, and (5) continuous for
the statutory limitations period. Which (if any) of these elements might have to
be modified where the right being acquired is not a right of possession, but a
right of use?
