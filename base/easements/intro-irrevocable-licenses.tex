An easement is distinct from a \textbf{license}. A license is permission from
the owner to enter the land. Because it is permissive, it is revocable. Many
difficulties with distinguishing easements from licenses arise when parties fail
to clearly bargain over the right to use land. \textit{See, e.g.}, \emph{Willow
Tex, Inc. v. Dimacopoulos}, 503 N.E.2d 99, 100 (N.Y. 1986) (``The writing must
establish unequivocally the grantor's intent to give \textit{for all time
to come} a use of the servient estate to the dominant estate. The policy of the
law favoring unrestricted use of realty requires that where there is any
ambiguity as to the permanence of the restriction to be imposed on the servient
estate, the right of use should be deemed a license, revocable at will by the
grantor, rather than an easement.'').  

Under the right circumstances, a license may become irrevocable.
