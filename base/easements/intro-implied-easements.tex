Easements may come into being without explicit agreements. They may arise from
equitable enforcement of implied agreements or references to maps or boundary
references in conveyances. \textsc{Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)}
\S~2.13. In this section, we focus on two forms of implied easements: An
\term{easement implied by existing use} and an \term{easement by necessity}.
Both such easements commonly arise as a byproduct of land transactions.
