An \term{easement by necessity} (or sometimes \term{way by necessity})
arises when land becomes landlocked or incapable of reasonable use absent an
easement. For example, if A owns a rectangular parcel bordered on the north,
east, and west by privately owned land and on the south by a public street, and
conveys to B a strip of her land on the northern boundary, B will acquire an
easement by necessity across the southern portion of the parcel retained by A,
as shown in Figure~\ref{f:easements-img002}.
