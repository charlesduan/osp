As public uses of waters expanded, so too did the public trust doctrine. In New
Jersey, the courts extended the public trust doctrine to protect recreational
uses. It then extended the public's right to access the ``wet sands,'' which is
land extending from the ocean to the average high tide water mark, to include
access via certain ``dry sands.''
