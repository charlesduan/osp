The \term{fee simple absolute} is the most complete interest in land that the
law will recognize. When we say that ``O owns Blackacre'' without any further
qualification, what we actually mean is that O owns a \textit{presently
possessory fee simple absolute }in Blackacre. The key distinguishing
characteristic of the fee simple absolute is that it has no inherent end---it
is an estate of \textit{indefinite duration}. It is descendible, devisable, and
alienable \textit{inter vivos}; so it can be \textit{transferred} to a new
owner, but it cannot be destroyed. At most, it can be carved up into lesser
estates and interests for a while, and we will spend most of the rest of this
chapter understanding how that happens.

At common law, as previously noted, the fee simple absolute was created by the
formula: ``to A and his heirs.'' That formula still works, but in modern usage
it is sufficient to simply say ``to A,'' and the use of such language in a
conveyance from the owner of a fee simple absolute will be presumed to create a
fee simple absolute in A.
