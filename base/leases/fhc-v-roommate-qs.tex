\item \textbf{What's a dwelling?} The FHA defines ``dwelling'' as ``any
building, structure, or portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or
intended for occupancy as, a residence by one or more families.'' \emph{Id.}
\S~3602(b).  Do you think the FHA applies to college dormitories?  Is it illegal
to reserve some dormitories for women or to have ethnic-themed dorms?  


\item \textbf{A broader Craigslist problem.} It's not unusual to stumble across
advertisements for apartments (as opposed to just roommate ads) on Craigslist
that violate the FHA.  If a local newspaper published similar ads they would be
liable under the FHA for publishing discriminatory material.  Why doesn't
anyone sue Craigslist?  The answer is that section 230(c) of the Communications
Decency Act provides internet service providers and website owners with broad
immunity from liability for content posted by third parties.  Craigslist and
other similar sites may voluntarily remove offending posts, but they are not
required to do so.
