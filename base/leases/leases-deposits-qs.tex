\item \textbf{Tenant self help?}  If tenants recognize that landlords often
cheat them out of their security deposits, why don't more tenants respond by
refusing to pay the last month's rent?  After all, eviction procedures almost
always take longer than 30 days.


\item \textbf{America v. England.} To solve the security deposit dilemma,
English law does not permit landlords to keep their tenants' deposits.  Rather,
they must place them with a government-approved holding agency.  If a dispute
arises over the money at the end of the lease, the parties are referred to an
arbitrator who works for the organization that holds the money.  The dispute
resolution service does not charge either party but they are bound by its
decision.  Should jurisdictions in the U.S. move toward this model?  Would it
change your opinion to know that English landlords routinely fail to comply
with these rules? Are there other solutions worth considering?
