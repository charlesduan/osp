Holdovers can also cause problems for other renters.  Suppose that before the
start of law school you agree to a one-year lease that begins on August 1. 
Although you've signed a binding lease agreement and have received a set of
keys, when your van pulls into the driveway on move-in day, you find that the
previous tenant hasn't left ``your'' apartment.  If the lease doesn't include a
contingency for such an event, what are your rights?
