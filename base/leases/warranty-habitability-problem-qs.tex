\item The Mad Hatter and the Alice each decide to rent an apartment in
Wonderland.  The Mad Hatter walks into a large apartment and sees a hole in the
roof, but he decides to rent the unit anyway.  The apartment that Alice decides
to lease has no obvious problems.  The next day, however, some mold spots
appear by one of the vents.  The mold grows rapidly and Alice starts to have
regular headaches and some trouble breathing.  Additionally, an unknown
troublemaker smashed Alice's air conditioning unit and it no longer works.  Can
either the Mad Hatter or Alice win a lawsuit against their landlord if their
problems aren't fixed?
