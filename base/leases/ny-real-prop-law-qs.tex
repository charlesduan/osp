\item Last year, X rented a storefront in a local strip mall and opened a
successful coffee shop.  The lease is for 10 years and includes the following
provision: ``No assignments or subleases without the landlord's consent. 
Landlord can only deny consent based on commercially reasonable objections.'' 
Recently X was offered her dream job on a coffee plantation in a faraway
country.  She now wishes to exit her lease.  Must the Landlord consent to the
following assignment proposals?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Alfred plans to open a mattress store.  He's a college dropout with no
business experience but his rich father will co-sign the lease and guarantee
all payments get made on time.

\item Bob, an experienced therapist with good credit, wants to open a marriage
counseling practice targeted at same-sex couples.  The landlord, however,
believes same-sex marriage is immoral and worries that the counseling center
will hurt the business of a Christian bookstore in the strip mall.

\item Cathy has a well-thought out plan to open a shooting range.  The Landlord
agrees to the assignment on the condition that Cathy increase the rent payment
by \$100/month.  Cathy refuses. 
\end{enumerate}
