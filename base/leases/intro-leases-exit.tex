Most leases expire either at the end of the agreed-upon term or when one party
serves the other with notice that they've decided not to renew for another
period.  Sometimes, however, either a tenant or landlord seeks to get out of
the lease before the negotiated term concludes. For example, a new job in a
faraway state, a family emergency, or a business failure can all change a
tenant's needs or ability to pay the rent.  We turn now to the legal
consequences of exiting a lease.
