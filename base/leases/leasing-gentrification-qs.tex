\item \textbf{Europe v. America.}  What do you think accounts for the different
views on rent control between European policy makers and their American
counterparts?

answer, what steps should government take to ensure access to affordable
housing? Should the government have any role at all in the housing market?

housing fit into the mix of economic regulations addressing problems of poverty
and equity?
