\item \textbf{The landlord's options.} Under what circumstances should a
landlord move to evict a tenant who holds over?  Are there any scenarios where
a landlord might want to keep a tenant who has already proven themselves
untrustworthy by staying past the agreed-upon term? 


\item \textbf{Drafting.} How can landlords draft leases to better protect
themselves from the threat of holdovers?


\item \textbf{A holdover problem.} Seven years ago, Tommy Hillclimber leased a
commercial building on a busy street from Lisa.  The lease was for a five-year
term with annual rent of \$100,000.  At the end of the term, Tommy retained
possession of the building but continued to make rent payments.  Lisa has
cashed all of Tommy's rent checks.  Last week, Sprawl-Mart contacted Lisa and
offered to rent the building for \$200,000 a year.  Lisa quickly sent notice to
Tommy stating that the lease will terminate in 30 days.  Does Tommy have to
vacate?
