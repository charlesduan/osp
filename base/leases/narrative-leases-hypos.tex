\reading{Lease Hypotheticals}

A professionally drafted lease will almost always make clear what type of
leasehold the parties have elected.  When problems arise it's often because
lessors and lessees have drafted legal documents without the help of a
qualified lawyer.  In the following examples try to figure out what kind of
leasehold the parties have created.  If it's a term of years, how long is the
term? If it's a periodic tenancy, what is the period?  
\begin{enumerate}
\item L and T sign an agreement that reads, ``The term is one year, beginning
September 1.''
\item L and T sign a lease that reads, ``This agreement lasts as long as the
parties consent.''
\item L and T sign an agreement that reads, ``The lease will run from September
1 until the following August 31.  One thousand dollars payable on the first of
every month.''
\item L and T enter a lease that reads in relevant part, ``the rent is \$48,000
per year, payable \$4,000 on the first of each month.''
\item L and T enter a lease that reads, ``the rent is \$1,000 per month.''  
\item L and T enter a lease that reads, ``the rent is \$1,000 per month and
lasts until the tenant completes medical school.'' 
\item L and T are negotiating on the phone over an apartment lease.  At the end
of the conversation L says, ``Have we got a deal?  Five years lease with rent
at \$10,000 a year?''  T replies, ``Great.  I accept. It's a deal.''
\end{enumerate}
