\item What right of ownership is at issue in \textit{Eyerman}? Is it a right of
use? Of alienation? Of testation? A distinct right to destroy? If the latter,
is such a right among the rights of property owners?

\item Could we understand Mrs. Johnston's instruction to raze her house to the
ground as an exercise of the right to exclude, extended in time to after her
death? Is this a useful way to think about her instruction? Either way, should
we allow owners to continue to control resources \textit{forever}---even long
after their deaths---if they so choose? (We will revisit this concern in our
unit on Estates and Future Interests).

\item If Mrs. Johnston had attempted to raze her house to the ground during her
lifetime, could anyone legally prevent her from doing so? If not, why can she
be prevented from ordering the destruction of her house by will?
