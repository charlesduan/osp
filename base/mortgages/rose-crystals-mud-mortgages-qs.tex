\item Bear in mind that crystals don't just help lenders, and mud doesn't just
help borrowers. It all depends on the particulars of the situation.  In fact,
as you read the materials, consider whether insistence on hard-edged rules
might aid \textit{borrowers} under today's circumstances, and whether this
would be justified.  


\item Carol Rose later describes the situations in which courts muddy
crystalline rules as cases involving ``ninnies, hard-luck cases, and the
occasional scoundrels who take advantage of them.'' As you read through the
rest of this chapter, consider whether that is a fair characterization of the
parties to the various disputes we will be studying.
