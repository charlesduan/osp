Along with the actors in the mortgage securitization chain described by Levitin,
many mortgage loans, particularly subprime loans, were made with the assistance
of a mortgage broker, who matched borrowers with lenders.  As you will see, the
broker's incentives did not line up with those of his or her borrower-clients.

\textbf{Reading notes}: Focus on the elements that made these loans bad loans. 
The discrimination is important, but so is how it was carried out.  If you
don't understand a loan provision, consider whether an average borrower
would---and then look it up!
