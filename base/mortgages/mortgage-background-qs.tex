Betty Finn buys a house for \$450,000.  She puts down \$90,000 and takes out a
mortgage for \$250,000 from Heather Chandler, and a second mortgage for
\$110,000 from Veronica Sawyer.  When Betty defaults, the house is sold for
\$500,000 at foreclosure.  Assuming the amounts due on the mortgages haven't
changed at all, how should the proceeds be distributed?  What would the answer
be if the house brought \$350,000 at foreclosure?
